# ZombieFable

This is an attempt of a fork in F# of https://github.com/magnars/zombieclj-s2. Not sure I'll be able to keep up, but I think it would be cool to see the difference between clojure script and fable.

## Stack

[SAFE Stack](https://safe-stack.github.io/) is used to bootstrap the project. Stack

## Install pre-requisites

You'll need to install the following pre-requisites in order to build SAFE applications

* The [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download)
* [FAKE 5](https://fake.build/) installed as a [global tool](https://fake.build/fake-gettingstarted.html#Install-FAKE)
* The [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) package manager (you an also use `npm` but the usage of `yarn` is encouraged).
* [Node LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed for the front end components.
* If you're running on OSX or Linux, you'll also need to install [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/).

## Work with the application

To concurrently run the server and the client components in watch mode use the following command:

```bash
fake build -t Run
```


You can use the included `Dockerfile` and `build.fsx` script to deploy your application as Docker container. You can find more regarding this topic in the [official template documentation](https://safe-stack.github.io/docs/template-docker/).

## Troubleshooting

* **fake not found** - If you fail to execute `fake` from command line after installing it as a global tool, you might need to add it to your `PATH` manually: (e.g. `export PATH="$HOME/.dotnet/tools:$PATH"` on unix) - [related GitHub issue](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/9321)
